Phone calls from the reality mining dataset.

The file call-Reality.txt has three columns:
caller callee timestamp

The caller and callee are integer IDs, starting from 1.
Timestamps are in seconds.

The file core-call-Reality.txt contains the ID numbers of the "core"
nodes. These are the individuals who participated in the study.

Some individuals did not send or receive a communication.
Thus, some nodes listed in core-call-Reality.txt do not
appear in call-Reality.txt.
