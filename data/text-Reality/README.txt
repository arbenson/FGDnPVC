SMS texts from the reality mining dataset.

The file text-Reality.txt has three columns:
sender receiver timestamp

The sender and receiver are integer IDs, starting from 1.
Timestamps are in seconds.

The file core-text-Reality.txt contains the ID numbers of the "core"
nodes. These are the individuals who participated in the study. Note that not
all of these nodes send or receive a text (i.e., they are isolated in the
graph).
